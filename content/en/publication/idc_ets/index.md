abstract: At present, China's data center industry is developing rapidly, with a large scale and huge power consumption, resulting in a large number of indirect greenhouse gas emissions. With the proposal of "carbon peak" and "carbon neutrality" goals, the data center can be brought into China’s national carbon emissions trading system to guide the green development of the data center and regulate the energy efficiency of the data center from a higher level. According to the operation mechanism of China’s national carbon emissions trading system and starting from the operation mechanism of each component of the data center, this paper designs the management mechanisms including the allocation method of carbon emission quota, carbon emission accounting method and data quality supervision of the data center, and determines the responsibility subject and scale boundary of the data center incorporated into China’s national carbon emissions trading system in combination with the existing policies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
